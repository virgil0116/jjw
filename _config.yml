# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  经常给自己定个小目标，不用太大，不要太小。
  稍微一努力就能实现最好。
  不管是哪个方面，自己感觉有用就好。
  保持乐观积极心态。
  Always set a small goal for yourself, not too big, not too small.
  A little effort will bring out the best.
  Either way, feel useful.
  Stay positive.
